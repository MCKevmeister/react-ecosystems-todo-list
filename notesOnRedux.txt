Redux

What does it solve?

Single state? No Props Drilling.

Components managing their own state? 
 * Fixes props drilling
 * Would require hoisting, but hard to know the state of the Component

 Global State Management?
* All componnets have access to state. 
* No props drilling
* No issue with sharing state
* However, there are no rules for accessing the state.
* Unrestricted global state is undesirable.

The Redux store
Redux uses a store which is a single JSON object.

How does Redux control the global state?

            { Redux Store }
Redux Actions           Reducers

Redux Actions

{ type, payload }

USER_DATA_LOADED
ITEM_ADDED_TO_CART

Expliciltly define the redux Actions instead of leaving it to chance

Reducers
Reducers are what should happen to the redux store (central state), when a given action occurs.

How Does Redux Work?

Components can only interact with the state by triggering Redux actions.

Unidrectional Data Flow

UI triggers action > State is updated > Components See updated state
